# The unit tests cover the collector's logic; they cannot see the compose wiring.
# Every engine is invoked through a shell command line in docker-compose.yml, and
# upstream tools change those underneath us.
#
# `strict` is not enough to catch that. Gitleaks kept `detect` as a deprecated
# alias that exits 0 and writes a valid but EMPTY sarif, so the old command line
# would report zero secrets and every structural check would pass. Only asking
# each engine "did you find the thing planted for you?" catches it.
#
# Runs the full pipeline over tests/fixtures/vulnerable-repo and asserts that
# every enabled engine actually produced findings.
