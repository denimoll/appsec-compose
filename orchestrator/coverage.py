"""Detect SCA blind spots — an engine that ran cleanly and saw nothing.

The policy gate only reasons about findings, so a dependency scanner that
parsed nothing at all looks exactly like a project with no vulnerabilities.
That is the most dangerous failure mode we have: a green build that never
inspected a single dependency.

We can prove the blind spot rather than guess at it: if the repo has dependency
manifests but the generated SBOM has no components, no engine resolved them.
